I'm just going to say it: Intel's Decision to axe Optane (chalcogenic Phase change) "storage class memory", was one of the Stupidest business decisions they ever made. I really can't wait for the patents to Expire? I Hope someone else, like IBM picks up the torch? ðŸ”¥

I had the 14G for running "experiments" when they first came out. Was like $35. I ran DB tests on it, and was mind blown. (Compared to my $400 SSDs of that era) Sure it didn't offer anything near the GB/$ of Samsung's multi-layer NAND SSDs! But you know what? I Don't care! The advantages are worth it; and when you're in it for the long haul - in 3 or 4 generations it won't matter. This is the same fundamental chemistry that was used on DVD-RW technology of the 90's just miniaturized and put in a "cell". These cells had been "designed" for > 1,000,000 read-erase cycles, and in testing the very 1st gen got over 250,000 which is still an achievement. They allow byte-addressing, something NAND Flash will never do. And are the perfect storage technology for high-throughput databases!

We've been waiting forever for real revolutionary memory technologies to Hit the market. I'm tired of all the empty promises from researchers "Startups" & universities! (Cough, Nantoro, Everspin, ...) Just look at this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_memory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoresistive_RAM#See_also When the hell are we ever going to see a real Disruptive storage technology reach mass market & volume production status? 2123? 2230? I've been tracking this market, and ever single company & "breakthrough" that has emerged in it, for over 12 years. And still Nothing. Nada... You can't go on Newegg and buy Any of this. It's for "Special customers only" like Defense & Aerospace (where Radiation hardening matters).

And yet this one was real, I had it in my hands.

Why cancel it? Beat's me. They're hemorrhaging money (and talent) right now, And it may take them 5-10 years to course correct. They Really should've kept it alive, or provided fab space for Micron to continue making them, and doing R&D towards perfected the technology, and should've looked at it as a long-term strategic investment in Conquering the enterprise data space? But "Stockholders" with their short term quarterly-earnings goals win. Speaking of Stockholders: HFT and banks are about the perfect use for it.

Because of this nonsense, and how unpredictable SSD lifetimes & BitRot are, I've had to add Tape backups as a final "peace of mind" Tier & factor to my storage strategy. Wish we could Trust Solid-State, or go "All in" on Flash but I can't.

Great & Informative Video, as alwasy! Hussein ðŸ˜ƒ
